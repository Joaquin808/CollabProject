  Title: JournalEntry_01
  JournalEntry: 'In the year 2084, in Mormon Row, Wyoming, my team of NASA climate
    scientists, in preparation for environmental catastrophe, began construction
    on a prototype shelter that could serve as a self-sustaining plot of untainted
    land.  The shelter consisted of an underground bunker, an average relatively
    plain farmhouse above said bunker, and a dome roughly 3x the size of the house,
    protecting the surrounding land.  '
