  Title: A New Friend
  JournalEntry: "By 2102 life had become somewhat routine for us, I took care of
    general maintenance, and my wife took care of resource management and taking
    care of our grandchild. However, my wife passed away due to lung cancer a few
    months later, due to exposure to air pollution, when we\u2019d leave the dome
    for supplies.  All I had left was my grandchild, and I was busy keeping us alive
    most of the time.  So I built them a friend, a little robotic companion, a dog."
