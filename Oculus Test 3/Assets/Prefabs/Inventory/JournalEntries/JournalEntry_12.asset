  JournalEntry: "A couple of years had passed, it's now the year 2105.  My grandchild
    is 18 years old, they grow up so fast.  But I heard on the radio that a group
    of stranded survivors in search of new shelter are out in the wastes, and I have
    to try to save them.  Me and my grandchild argued but I have to leave anyway,
    we haven\u2019t had face to face contact with anyone else in years.  We need
    to do everything in our power to save who we can, I must learn from my past mistakes. 
    I pray I come back okay, but I know my grandchild will be okay either way.  If
    by chance you get ahold of these and get to listen to them, I love you.  Please
    be safe."
