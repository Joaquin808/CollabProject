  Title: The Idea
  JournalEntry: Modeled on my family, my wife and grandchild, the bunker was supposed
    to be able to protect and provide for a small group of people.  It was meant
    to measure how plausible similar projects would work for larger groups of people. 
    The dome, which was made out of a translucent synthetic metal, was meant to withstand
    impacts from debris, extreme heat, and noxious gas.
