  Title: JournalEntry_08
  JournalEntry: "Through the following years, conditions in the outside world worsened. 
    The land was heated, and conditions for extreme weather heightened.  By 2098,
    the outside world was approaching uninhabitability.  I smuggled in my wife and
    grandchild, trying to get ahead of this environmental disaster, more or less
    dooming the rest of my team, a fact that hasn\u2019t been lost on me, a fact
    that keeps me up at night often."
