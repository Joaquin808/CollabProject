  Title: Survival
  JournalEntry: The prototype experiment became less about the protection of the
    masses, and more about the conservation of human life during the throes of the
    environmental apocalypse.  Humanity was running out of time, and the bunkers
    could've only feasibly been mass produced via the funding of the United States
    government, if not multiple world governments.  It became obvious to me at some
    point that me and my family may be the best residents.
