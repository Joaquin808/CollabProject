  Title: JournalEntry_06
  JournalEntry: Only a few domes were built around the U.S., and the project was
    completed in 2094.  Most were dedicated to the highest ranking members of government,
    the President and his family, the Vice President and his family as well, along
    with many others.  Of course some of the leading scientists in the U.S. would
    also get reserved slots, but regardless of this, none of our team could find
    space in any of these domes.
