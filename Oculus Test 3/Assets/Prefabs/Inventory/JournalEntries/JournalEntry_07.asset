  Title: JournalEntry_07
  JournalEntry: This meant that despite the best efforts of the team, and the efficacy
    of our invention, there would only be one surefire way to survive the climate
    change apocalypse, occupying the dome.  Many members of the team lobbied for
    the opportunity to occupy the bunker with their spouses and kin, but they all
    knew that they'd be almost certainly denied access to these highly sought after
    refuges.
