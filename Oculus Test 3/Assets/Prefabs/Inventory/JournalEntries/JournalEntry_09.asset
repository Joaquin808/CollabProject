  Title: A New Earth
  JournalEntry: "By 2101 all life not within some sort of bunker had been destroyed. 
    The surface of the Earth became superheated and barren, clean water was impossible
    to find.  Not only this but noxious gases filled the troposphere, meaning that
    even if we could venture out into the wastes with protective gear, we\u2019d
    need a rebreather, and we could only do it for a brief period of time.  Beyond
    this, extreme weather such as tornadoes, wildfires, and even hurricanes (yes
    in Wyoming) were a common occurrence."
