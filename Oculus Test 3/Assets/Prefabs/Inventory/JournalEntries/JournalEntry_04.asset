  Title: Losing the Fight
  JournalEntry: 'The bunker was initially created as a precaution, but due to the
    trends amongst the multiple fossil fuel industries despite the lobbying of me
    and my wife, it became more and more apparent that the bunker would be a necessity. 
    Me and my team knew that they would need to build more of these bunkers.  Many
    more.  We pleaded with the United States government and its most prominent individuals
    to grant funding for mass construction, but to no avail. '
