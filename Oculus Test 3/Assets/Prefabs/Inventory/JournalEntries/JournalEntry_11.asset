  JournalEntry: "Despite my overwhelming grief, I knew that I might be facing my
    demise soon as well.  It\u2019s at this time I started developing an AI on the
    bunker\u2019s main PC, so there is something that could take care of my grandchild
    when I\u2019m no longer here.  Despite this, the two of us started to grow close,
    and as they grew up through their teenage years, they learned much about the
    reality of their situation and the responsibilities they'd have to contend with
    after both of their caretakers pass. "
