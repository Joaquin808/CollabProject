  Title: JournalEntry_03
  JournalEntry: The center of the bunker/dome's resource management, was a supercomputer
    within the bunker.  It had monitoring and PA systems across the whole facility,
    in order to both observe the status of resources, as well as alert the occupants
    to problems that may arise.  Without this supercomputer, survival would be almost
    impossible for the occupants.
